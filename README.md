# Bookly - A Flutter Book Application ðŸ“š

**Bookly** is a book app where users can:
- Search for books (initially focusing on Flutter and Dart books via API)
- Preview and read books for free.

This project allowed me to explore and implement various advanced Flutter concepts and libraries, including:

- **MVVM Pattern**: Organized code by separating business logic from UI for better scalability and maintainability.
- **go_router**: Simplified navigation with declarative routes, supporting deep links.
- **get_it**: Managed dependencies using service locators to ensure efficient performance.
- **Cubit**: Efficiently handled state management, updating UI reactively based on data changes.
- **Dartz**: Applied functional programming for safer error handling and cleaner async code.
- **Dio**: Used for making robust HTTP requests with advanced error handling.
- **Skeletonizer**: Enhanced user experience with skeleton loading animations during data fetching.
- **url_launcher**: Allowed users to preview and read books via external URLs from within the app.

Each tool played a vital role in improving both development efficiency and the overall user experience.
